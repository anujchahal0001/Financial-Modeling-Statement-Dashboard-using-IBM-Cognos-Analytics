ðŸ“Š Financial Modeling Statement Dashboard â€“ Description
This financial modeling dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key financial indicators, including revenue, market capitalization, earnings, P/E ratios, EPS (Earnings Per Share), dividend metrics, and liquidity indicators. The dashboard is a powerful tool for financial analysts, business stakeholders, and investors to make data-driven decisions.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Revenue vs. Market Cap and Earnings Analysis
The line chart at the top of the second screenshot shows the trend of market capitalization ($B) and revenue ($B) over time.

The central value shows a market cap of $2.03K billion, highlighting the current valuation of the company.

Revenue is listed as $476.83 billion, showing a 326.42% increase, indicating strong historical growth.

ðŸ”¹ 2. P/E Ratio and Operating Margin (%)
These metrics, although not shown numerically in the graph, are part of the comparison. A lower P/E ratio generally reflects undervaluation, while a higher operating margin suggests efficient business operations.

The dynamic relationship between revenue, earnings, and market valuation allows users to evaluate profitability and company efficiency over time.

ðŸ“ˆ Measures Breakdown Over the Years (Bottom Line Chart)
The multi-line graph provides a yearly comparison of:

Revenue ($B)

EPS ($)

Earnings ($B)

Dividend Yield (%)

Cash on Hand ($B)

A noticeable peak around 2015â€“2016 indicates a surge in earnings and cash on hand, which may be linked to business expansion or investment returns.

Fluctuations in dividend yield help assess shareholder returns.

ðŸ“‰ Total Assets, Liabilities, Net Assets & Debt
The horizontal bar chart (first screenshot) compares:

Total Assets ($B) (brown)

Total Liabilities ($B) (green)

Net Assets ($B) (blue)

Total Debt ($B) (pink)

These are segmented by P/E, P/S, and P/B ratios â€” enabling multi-dimensional analysis by financial valuation metrics.

The visualization assists in assessing financial leverage, risk exposure, and asset strength.

ðŸ’µ Cash on Hand for Dividend
The waterfall chart at the bottom shows:

Incremental changes in available cash over time for dividend disbursement.

Green bars indicate increase, red shows decrease, and purple represents total cash on hand.

This helps gauge the liquidity position and financial sustainability for rewarding shareholders.
